# Campagna project (back-end)

Campagna is the concept-idea of an e-commerce platform to promote products and tourism in a small rural community.

The app is built with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL at the back-end, and JS React in the front- end.

This repository hosts the back-end side. The app is setup to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Before running the app, you should create a <em>campagna</em> database: to create it from terminal you can use the following command:
```javascript
createdb campagna
```

Once the database is created, execute the runner file <em>CampagnaApplication.java</em> under  
<em>/src/main/java/com/example/codeclan/capstoneproject/campagna</em>.

The back-end app will run the logics and feed the database.

Once done, you can run the front-end. Find the repository at https://github.com/pepcasula/CampagnaFrontEnd.
